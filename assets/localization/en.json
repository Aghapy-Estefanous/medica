By 8 months, it's typical for your baby to be eating one to two meals a day.\nWhenever you introduce a new food, start with a very small amount (a teaspoon or two) to allow your baby to get used to a new flavor and texture.",

As your baby's eating skills improve, gradually introduce more textures and soft finger foods.\nIt's fine to serve your baby what the rest of the family is eating – just watch out for added sugars, which aren't recommended for children under 2. Check the Nutrition Facts label on packaged foods, and try to steer clear of foods that list 1 gram or more of 'Added Sugars.'",


  "babyFeedingGuideIntro":"Use this baby feeding guide to find out what and how much to feed your child in the first year. The amounts are general recommendations only, so don't worry if your little one eats a bit more or less than suggested. It's always a good idea to discuss your plan for starting solids with your child's doctor before getting started.",

  "painfulLetdownExplanation":"A tingling sensation is typical when the milk ducts in your breasts constrict to pump milk into the nipples (this is called letdown). But some women have pain during letdown.\n\nThis can happen if you're producing too much milk, or if you have clogged ducts or mastitis (an inflammation of breast tissue). It can also happen if you have a thrush on your nipples/breasts. Use breathing or relaxation techniques to cope, and see your provider if you have any signs of infection, such as a fever or itchy, red, or burning nipples.\n\nLearn more about handling painful letdown.",

  "vasospasmExplanation" :"Restricted blood flow caused by tightening blood vessels in your breasts can cause a burning or stabbing pain. You may notice that your breasts become blanched and your nipples change color (become more purple or red). Having cracked nipples or an infection can make the pain worse. Keeping your breasts warm and avoiding caffeine may help. But see your healthcare provider or lactation consultant to get to the underlying reason for the vasospasms. They may recommend medication.",


  "teethingExplanation":"Your baby may get new teeth without it affecting breastfeeding in the least. But – in an effort to adjust because of the pain they feel on their gums when nursing – they may change position or latch, or even bite to relieve the discomfort.\n\nPay attention to your baby's latch, and experiment with different breastfeeding positions. Anticipate a bite, when you can (you may notice your baby moves their tongue out of the way first), and unlatch your baby by putting your finger in the corner of their mouth. Massaging your baby's gums or giving them a teether before nursing may help.",


  "sensitiveNipplesExplanation":"Tender nipples are often an early sign of pregnancy or an imminent menstrual period. And some breast surgeries may result in numbness or even pain in your nipple or breast, because of nerve damage. Having your baby latch on when your nipples are feeling sensitive can be very uncomfortable. To avoid nipple pain, make sure your baby has a good latch (they aren't sucking on the end of your nipple, for example).",

  "postpartumCrampingExplanation":"After you deliver your baby, your uterus needs to return to its pre-pregnancy size. You may feel some cramping when this happens, and the cramping may be especially intense while nursing. That's because breastfeeding can stimulate uterine contractions – which is good, though sometimes painful.\n\nBreathing exercises and massage may help you get through the cramping. If needed, you can also take over-the-counter pain relievers to help with the pain, which should disappear within a week or so.",

  "breastfeedingNotAlwaysHard":"Breastfeeding isn't always hard. Sometimes the whole process goes smoothly and comfortably, and a mom and baby breastfeed for months or years without a hitch. But breastfeeding often comes with challenges, big and little. Your baby may take some time to learn to latch on, for example, or you may struggle with milk supply, pain, or infection. Complications like these often come at the beginning of your breastfeeding journey, which can be especially discouraging.",

  "breastfeedingPain":"Breastfeeding shouldn't hurt. If it does, it's a sign that something's wrong. Most often it's because your baby isn't latching well (see below). A lactation consultant can help you determine if that's the case and show you how to correct your baby's latch.\n\nOther issues that cause discomfort can pop up, too, such as:",
